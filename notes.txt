An applet is a program
that are primarily used in internet computing. They can be transported 
to the internet from one computer to another computer and run using 
applet  viewer and any java based platform.
An applet can do many things for us, can display graphics, play songs,
accept user inputs, create animations,etx.

An applet developed locally is known as local applet.
When a web page is trying to locate local applet, it does not need to 
use internet. Local system does not require internet connection.
A remote applet is that which is developed by someone else and stored
on a remote computer and connected to computer.
We can download remote applet on our computer via internet and run it.

In order to locate and load a remote applet, we must know applet address
on the way. This address is known as uniform resource locator and must
be specified as in the applet document as the value of codebase attribute.
In case of local applet, codebase may be abesent or may specify local
directory.

Difference between applets and application:

1. Applet do not use main method() for execution of code. Applets when 
   loaded, automatically calls certain methods of applets class to start
   and excute applet code.

2. Unlike the standalone application, applets cannot be run independently
   they are run from a inside a web page, using a special feature known
   as HTML tag.

3. Applet cannot read from or write to the files in the local computer.

4. Applets cannot communicate with other servers on the network.

5. Appletes cannot run any program from local computer.

6. Applets are restricated from using libraries from other languages such
   as C or C++.


Applets Lifecycle:

Every applet inherits a set of default from the Applet class. As a result,
when an applet is loaded it undergoes a series of changes in its state.
The applet states include :

1. Born or initialisation state : 
   Applet enters the initialized state when
   it is first loaded. It is achieved by calling init method of applet
   class. The applet is born. At this stage, we may do following if 
   required:
   1. Create object needed by the applet.
   2. Set up initial values.
   3. Load images or fonts.
   4. Set up colors.
   
   The initiazation state occurs only once in the applet life cycle.
   To provide any of the behaviour mentioned above, we must override the 
   init(). 
   The general format is:
   public void init()
   {
      -----;
      -----;
   }

2. Running state: 
   The applet enters the running state when the system calls
   the start method of the applet class. This occurs automatically after
   the applet is initialized. Starting can also occur if the applet is already in
   stopped state. The start method may be called once. We may override
   the start() to create a thread to control its applet. 

3. Ideal or stopped state:
   An applet becomes ideal when it is stopped from running. Stopping 
   occurs automatically when we leave the page containing the currently
   running applet.
   We can also do so by calling stop method explicitly. If we use a thread
   to run the applet, then we must use stop() to terminate the thread.

   public void stop(){}

4. Dead state:
   An applet is said to be dead when it is removed from memory. This occurs
   automatically by invoking the destroy() when we quit the browser.
   Like initialisation, destroying stage occurs only once in the applet
   lifecycle.
   If the applet has created any resources like threads we may override
   the destroy() to clean up this resources.

   public void destroy(){}

5. Display state:
   Applet used to the display state whenever it has to perform output 
   operations on the screen. This happens immediately after the applet
   enters into the running state. The paint() is called to accomplish 
   this task. Almost every applet will have a paint(). The default
   version of paint() does nothing. Therefore, we must override this method
   if we want anything to display on the screen.
